description,"Nothing much to see here... It's just a normal crossroads. You can travel west towards what appears to be a city. You can climb up the elevated plateau to the north or head down the road to the east. To the south there is a vast swath of land and a mirage of mountains covered in myst. That is where you came from. And you're not coming back."
