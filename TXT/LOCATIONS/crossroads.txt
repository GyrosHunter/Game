enter,"You have arrived at the crossroads. Nothing to see here. Three roads are leading east, west and north. As the wind is gently blowing, you notice an old paper lying at the side of the road..."
description,"Nothing much to see here... It's just a normal crossroads. From here, you can travel west towards what appears to be a city. You can climb up the elevated plateau to the north or head down the road to the east. To the south there is a vast swath of land and a mirage of mountains covered in myst. That is where you came from. And you're not coming back."
